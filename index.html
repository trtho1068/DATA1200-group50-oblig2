          <p>
            This is a picture was photographed in Innlandet county in Norway.
            One thing that immediately becomes clear when one observes this
            picture is that the picture was in fact not captured during
            winter. We are certain that this statement in fact is true due to
            the green vegetation and the lack of snow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Three colours dominate the template of
            this picture, these colours are blue, white and green, but we can
            also observe elements of grey, brown and even tones of yellow.
          </p>
          <h3>The meaning behind the picture</h3>
          <p>
            If we were to summarize the essential themes in this picture it
            would be potential, growth and life, but also doom, which is
            inherent to al life. We start by looking at the picture from the
            left, and what do we see? An open field, ripe for opportunity and
            potential, and in the background, we see great hills symbolizing
            the great potential of the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we move our eyes further to the right, we observe that
            the vegetation starts to grow, and soon enough they have become
            threes. Threes that represent the life and al its greatness.
            At the same time, we observe that the hills in the background
            steadily becomes smaller, this fall in height represents how all
            life one day must fall, and that nothing can last forever.
          </p>
          <p>Lastly, we
            observe a path that leads to the right, which symbolizes the path
            into the future. This path leads out of our field of view
            representing how the future is unknown, further strengthening the
            theme of life and the theme of potential.
