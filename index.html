<p>Photographer: Sigurd</p>
<p>This is a picture was photographed in Innlandet county in Norway. One thing that immediately becomes clear when
  one observes this picture is that the picture was in fact not captured during winter. We are certain that this
  statement in fact is true due to the green vegetation and the lack of snow. Three colours dominate the template of
  this pictures, these colours are blue, white and green, but we can also observe elements of grey, brown and even
  tones of yellow.</p>
<h3>The meaning behind the picture</h3>
<p>If we were to summarize the essential themes in this picture it would be potential, growth and life, but also
  doom, which is inherent to al life. We start by looking at the picture from the left, and what do we see?
  An open field, ripe for opportunity and potential, and in the background, we see great hills symbolizing the
  great potential of the future. As we move our eyes further to the right, we observe that the vegetation starts
  to grow, and soon enough they have become threes. Threes that represent the life and al its greatness.
  At the same time, we observe that the hills in the background steadily becomes smaller, this fall in hight
  represents how all life one day must fall, and that nothing can last forever. Lastly, we observe a path that
  leads to the right, which symbolizes the path into the future. This path leads out of our field of view
  representing how the future is unknown, further strengthening the theme of life and the theme of potential.</p>
